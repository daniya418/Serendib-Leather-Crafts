            Sculpture is an old art form that served, and still serves mankind
            in diverse ways. We have sculpture for Magical, Religious, Social,
            Political and Agricultural, as well as for Tourism purposes. For the
            purpose of this project, the focus is on materials for sculpture.
            The conventional materials such as wood, cement, plaster of Paris,
            wax, metal, plastic and stone, that have been used for some time
            now, are either inconvenient to transport, or expensive to import.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Now that there is a boost in the tourism industry in Ghana, the
            demand for sculpture and other art forms is high. Having seen and
            appreciated sculptures made from different materials, there is the
            need to explore leather, which will be of taste to tourists and
            other collectors. Another remarkable thing is that, the Senior
            Secondary sculpture syllabus emphasizes on the creative utilization
            of local materials and preparation of students to be self-employed,
            so that some of them could establish small-scale industries.
            Incidentally, Ghana can boast of vast savannah within which
            livestock thrive. This yields a lot of leather, which is used by a
            few leather artists to produce leather bags and other articles.
            Producing sculpture in different and unknown materials techniques
            and styles will be an innovation and attraction.

            Leather is a very durable, and when properly treated, a very
            comfortable material. Since it is made from the hide of animals, it
            can come from cows, buffalo, deer, horses, goats, wolf, fox, rats,
            rabbit, even snakes, alligators, fish, and other animals such as
            giraffe and zebra (though these are much more rare). Most leather
            comes from cows. Let’s take a look at the history of leather craft
            and leather uses throughout history.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Throughout time man has hunted animals and used as many parts of
            them as possible for living. In prehistoric and ancient times, man
            would generally use animal hides for clothing, with the fur still on
            them to serve as protection from the elements. Evidence for
            hideworking, scraping hides for tanning, exists from around 400,000
            years ago.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The earliest known bone awls appear between 84,000 and 72,000 years
            ago in South Africa. Based on their wear patterns, it is believed
            they were used to pierce materials.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In the Stone Age, we begin to see some of the earliest confirmed
            leather tanning tools around 5,000 BC, in ancient Sumer (modern-day
            southern Iraq). The oldest known leather footwear was found in a
            cave in Armenia, dating from around 3,500 BC. That’s old! Animal
            hides would often be used for clothing, footwear, and shelters to
            protect people from the elements.

            Leather shaping or molding consists of soaking a piece of leather in
            water to greatly increase pliability and then shaping it by hand or
            with the use of objects or even molds as forms. As the leather dries
            it stiffens and holds its shape. Carving and stamping may be done
            prior to or after molding. Molding has become popular among
            hobbyists whose crafts are related to fantasy, goth/steampunk
            culture and cosplay as well as those interested in more classic
            styling of bags and household items. Two well known pieces of molded
            leather are part of the funerary achievements of Edward, the Black
            Prince, the heraldic crest and shield.

            Construction and Assemblage are simultaneously used in sculpture.
            There may be a little difference. Construction in sculpture is made
            with the same type of material, while assemblage is the process by
            which individual pieces or objects are brought together from
            different types of material to form a sculpture. Some writers make a
            distinction between assembling, in which parts of the sculpture are
            simply placed on or near each other, and constructing, in which the
            parts are actually joined together through welding, nailing or
            similar procedure. We have chosen to use the term, ‘assemblage’ for
            both types of work, because often the line separating one from the
            other is a fine one.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            However, in the end, it is the materials that are put together to
            create a form. Chapman, (1978:28) also has this say about
            construction and assemblage. “In assembling or construction
            sculpture, the artist selects and groups materials to create a new
            form”. It has also been confirmed by Gilbert (1998:276) that:
            “Louise Nevelson used assemblage as a means of unifying her
            arrangements of disparate items and shapes into to grand
            construction”. Gilbert, (1998:277) went on further to say that:
            “Piscasso’s witty 1943 assemblage entitled, Bull’s Head, is a
            remarkable example of his genius for synthesis, where he combined a
            bicycle seat in the reverse direction and handle-bar into a
            conflated imagery”.
